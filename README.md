# Sequence-Equation-algo
This program finds values of y that satisfy the equation p(p(y)) = x for every x between 1 and n; it solves the Sequence Equation problem. By using a dictionary to map array values to their positions, the code locates each x. placement to perform a second search and obtain the last result.
